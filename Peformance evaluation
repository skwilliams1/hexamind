The code begins by asking what player the user would like to be. Player 1 always goes first whether it is the AI or user. The player enters the vertex of edges they want to connect. The AI's selection of vertexes is made from the use of the minimax function assisted by the scoring_hueristic function which work together to select the best edge based on the current state of the graph. The players alternate until one of the agents win which is caused by the other agent forming a triangle with their moves or until a tie occurs.
